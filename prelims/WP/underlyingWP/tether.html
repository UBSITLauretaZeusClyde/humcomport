        <h1>What is Tether (USDT)?</h1>

        <p>Tether (USDT) is a cryptocurrency stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar and backed "100% by Tether's reserves," according to its website.Tether is owned by iFinex, the Hong Kong-registered company that also owns the crypto exchange BitFinex.</p>

        <p>Tether was launched as RealCoin in July 2014 and was rebranded as Tether in November 2014. Originally based on the Bitcoin blockchain, Tether now supports Bitcoin's Omni and Liquid protocols as well as the Ethereum, TRON, EOS, Algorand, Solana, and Bitcoin Cash (SLP) blockchains.</p>

        <p>As of January 2023, Tether was the third-largest cryptocurrency after Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) and the largest stablecoin with a market capitalization of nearly $68 billion.CoinMarketCap. "Today's Cryptocurrency Prices by Market Cap."In 2022, Tether's USDT accounted for most of the exchanges out of Bitcoin by value.</p>


        <p>The roots of Tether date back a decade, to when J.R. Willet was looking to build new cryptocurrencies on the Bitcoin protocol. Willet implemented this idea with Mastercoin, and one of its original members would later become the co-founder of Tether in 2014.Using Tether for liquidity began when it was added to the BitFinex exchange in January 2015.Recent market turbulence, which saw the price of TerraUSD, another stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar, drop to less than $0.23, caused Tether to break its $1 peg. The decline was largely driven by investors’ fears that if one stablecoin can break its peg, others can, too.“As an asset-backed stablecoin, with holdings primarily in U.S. Treasurys, [Tether] stands a far better chance of weathering the current tsunami rocking the digital asset world,” says Marc LoPresti, managing director of The Strategic Funds. He says the only stablecoin with comparable collateral quality is USD Coin.Stablecoins remain a popular choice among crypto traders, and Tether weathered controversies about liquidity and the adequacy of its reserves.As recently as 2022, the company did not offer much clarity regarding its reserves. At one point, Tether’s website merely stated that “All Tether tokens are pegged at 1-to-1 with a matching fiat currency and are backed 100% by Tether’s reserves.”Adam Carlton, CEO of crypto wallet Pink Panda, says Tether’s history of being transparent about how the coin is backed hasn’t always been clear or consistent.
        “It has a very questionable legal past, and to this day, its actual reserves are still quite opaque and believed to be substantially composed of unknown sources of commercial paper,” Carlton says.Other crypto experts say it’s somewhat accepted that through that concept of how comfortable they are—it’s very clear Tether is not backed Crypto.to maintain its peg to the dollar instead of cash reserves. The collapse of this system is widely cited as one of the main causes of the ongoing crypto winter.Relying on an algorithm rather than cash reserves caused TerraUSD to lose its price peg during a major liquidity crunch in early 2022. UST relied on a sister token called Luna plus a huge reserve of Bitcoin to back its 1-to-1 peg.  The TerraUSD meltdown shocked the cryptocurrency market, which was already experiencing other difficulties at the time. The so-called Terra/Luna crash ended up driving down the price of Bitcoin, and it’s estimated that caused $300 billion in losses across the entire market.</p>
